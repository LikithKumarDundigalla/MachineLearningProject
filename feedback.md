## Report

### Sections

- Abstract (5/5)
- Introduction (0/10)
  - The tone doesn't sound quite right --- it needs to be a bit more formal.
    Think 'research paper', rather than 'blog post'. Also, the first paragraph
    is wholly lifted from
    https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/04/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-model-to-distinguish-if-its-human-or-chatgpt/#Implementation,
    which counts as plagiarism.
- Related Work (10/10)
- Procedure (12/15)
    - Representation
    - Algorithm/equations (if appropriate)
    - Summary figure
    - General feedback
      - What do the symbols 't' and 'd' mean in TF(t, d) and IDF(t, D)?
      - You have provided the general Bayes rule equation, but you should
        provide the equation for the multinomial naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluation (5/10)
  - Did you perform cross-validation?
- Results (10/10)
- Conclusion (5/5)
- References (5/5)

### Polish
- Is the writing clear and free of logical errors? (5/5)
- Is the writing free of spelling and grammar mistakes? (5/5)

## Reproducibility

- Is the code submitted? (0/5)
  - Large chunks of code overlap with existing project.
- Is the code well-documented? (5/5)
- Are there instructions on how to use the code and data to reproduce your
  results? (3/3)
- Are the instructions clear? (2/2)
- Is the data provided (if < 100MB) (or are there instructions to get it if >
  100MB)? (5/5)

## Extra credit

- NeurIPS template used (10/10)

## General Feedback

- It looks like used an existing project as a starting point and added
  components from other projects. It seems like you did a substantial amount of
  work on your own, so I am ok with it. However, it is still not acceptable to
  lift large chunks of code or text from other projects. But since you cited
  your sources clearly, I will not give you a zero on the whole project. But I
  will give you 0/10 in the introduction section and 0/5 on the 'code' section.

Total: 87/100
